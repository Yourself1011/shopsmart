# shopsmart

## 🧠 Inspiration
Did you know that the average person spends more than 100 hours a year on grocery shopping? We wanted to reduce the time and frustration that people might experience at a grocery store when they can't find the items they need, or after when they realize they have to go banana-less until the next trip to the store.

## 🛒 What it does
- Shopsmart is a minimalistic website that will plan your shopping route for you, minimizing distractions and giving you a preplanned route so you won't get lost.
- Saves you time, frustration, and money - that's a win win win!

## 💻 How we built it
- React for the app
- Sass for styling
- Webpack for bundling
- Canvas for rendering the route

## ❓ Challenges we ran into
- One of our team members couldn't participate, but he didn't say anything until the hackathon was 3 hours underway. We wasted a lot of time frantically spamming him on Discord.
- We found another team member, but he only knew Python, no front-end technologies, so he couldn't help. (Not saying he's bad, he's an amazing guy)
- While writing this, I (Li Feng) accidentally closed the tab and lost all of my progress. This is the reason why the story might have speling misstaykes.

## 🎊 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Using complex algorithms like breadth-first search and minimum spanning tree
- Creating a full front-end app with only two people

## 💪 What we learned
- Don't start the pitch with 10 minutes before the deadline.
- Listen to the organizers' warnings to not start the pitch this late.
- Brainstorm ideas before the hackathon.
- ~~Get better teammates~~
- submit on time lol

We are planning to use AI and Machine Learning, and give support for the Metaverse and cyborgs.
